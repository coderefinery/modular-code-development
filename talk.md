## Simple vs. easy

## [The tar pit](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf)

- Over time software tends to become harder and harder to reason about
- Small changes become harder to implement
- Bugs start appearing in unexpected places
- More time is spent debugging than developing
- Complexity strangles development because it does not scale well

(Slide adapted from [Complexity in software development by Jonas Juselius](https://github.com/scisoft/complexity))

## Modularity and composition

- Build complex behavior from simple components
- We can reason about the components and the composite
- Composition is key to managing complexity
- Modularity does not imply simplicity, but is enabled by it

## Purity

- Pure functions have no notion of state: They take input values and return
  values
- Given the same input, a pure function *always* returns the same value
- Function calls can be optimized away
- Pure function == data

## Example: pure vs. stateful

### a) pure

```python
# function which computes the body mass index
def get_bmi(mass_kg, height_m):
    return mass_kg/(height_m**2)

# compute the body mass index
bmi = get_bmi(mass_kg=90.0, height_m=1.91))
```

### b) stateful

```python
mass_kg = 90.0
height_m = 1.91
bmi = 0.0

# function which computes the body mass index
def get_bmi():
    global bmi
    bmi = mass_kg/(height_m**2)

# compute the body mass index
get_bmi()
```

## Pure functions are easier to

- Test
- Understand
- Reuse
- Parallelize
- Simplify
- Optimize

---

## Recommendations

- I/O is impure
- Keep I/O on the outside and connected
- Keep the inside of your code pure/stateless

---

## Divide and conquer

- Split the code up
- Construct your program from parts:
  - functions
  - modules
  - packages (Python) or libraries (C or or C++ or Fortran)

---

## Functions, functions, functions

- Build your code from functions
- Break your code down to more functions
  - if you have too many levels of indentation
  - if a function gets too long
  - if a function does more than one thing
  - if you find it hard to name a function

---

## Encapsulation

- Hide internals by language or by convention (header file in C/C++,
  public/private in Fortran, underscores in Python)
- "Python has no locked doors; it's a consenting adults language.
  If you open the door you're responsible for what you see." [R. Hettinger]
- Expose the "what", hide the "how"

## Import and export

- Import as little as possible
- Export as little as possible

---

## Simplicity and clarity before elegance before efficiency

### Avoid premature optimization

- Do not optimize
- If you have to optimize, optimize later
- If you have to optimize, measure, do not guess

### Simple is better than complex

- If you cannot understand or explain a function on a cold gray Monday morning before coffee, it is too complex. (Quote adapted from [Pieter Hintjens, Social Architecture, 2009](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/social-architecture/details))

---

## Conclusions

- Divide and isolate
- Introduce tests early
- Compose your code out of **pure functions**
- Prefer immutable data structures
- Do not overuse classes
